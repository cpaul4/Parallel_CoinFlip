Parallel_CoinFlip
=================
This is a Java assignment that I did for my Parallel Programming class. The SealedDES class code was given to us and I just
wrote the CoinFLip class code. This program was written to use parallel programming to flip a large number of coins quickly. It asks how many threads you want to run and then how many coins you want to flip. Using more than 1 thread is what makes the program run in parallel. At the end, it outputs how fast it took the program to complete the coin flips and how many heads there were.
